**SUMMARY**

This project is intended to be a rewrite of Cythen, my very bare basic game
engine. I'm doing this because I'm bored this December afternoon. We'll see how
far this rewrite goes.

**What's different?**

This time around, I want to rethink the way the program handles different
regions within the game, and the characters that are located within those
regions. I also want to have an easier way of modifying these regions, perhaps
by having them on PNG files, which are then translated by a script into a text
resource file that can be accessed by the main program. And finally, I want to
have better documentation.
